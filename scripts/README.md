Simulation and Real-Data Examples
==============================================
This directory provides the scripts to reproduce the simulations and tables from the Computational examples section of the StepMix paper. The script to reproduce the application example is also accessible here.

Simulation Examples
--------------------------
Simulation results can be reproduced with the following commands:

```bash
# Outcome simulation
python3 run_bakk_simulation.py -s 500
# Covariate simulation
python3 run_bakk_simulation.py -s 500 -c
# Complete simulation
python3 run_bakk_simulation_complete.py -s 500
```
All three commands should output the simulation tables from the paper. You can ignore the UserWarnings.


Real-Data Example
-----------------------
The data come from the combined 1976 and 1977 datasets of the American General Social Survey (GSS) and were obtained 
using the R package `gssr` (https://github.com/kjhealy/gssr). The dataset is composed of the following 4 variables: 

 - `papres`: Father's occupational prestige score
    - 0="Low", 1="Medium", 2="High"
 - `madeg`: Mother's highest degree
    - 0="Less than high school", 1="High school", 2="Associate/Junior college", 3="Bachelor", 4="Graduate"
 - `padeg`: Father's highest degree
    - 0="Less than high school", 1="High school", 2="Associate/Junior college", 3="Bachelor", 4="Graduate"
 - `realinc1000`: Respondent’s family income measured in thousands of dollars

The `papres`, `madeg`, and `padeg` variables are used as items for the measurement model. The `realinc1000` variable, 
used as the distal outcome, was obtained by dividing each value of the original variable `realinc` 
(respondent’s family income in constant dollars) by 1000. Please refer to the article for more information.

First [download the dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vdSzzBe7tPxfQ_X-hUuF3qidDd6CWFiL/view?usp=drive_link), then run the following command:
```bash
python3 run_real_example.py --n_repetitions 100 --max_iter 10000
```

Running the above may take a while. You can the lower the number of bootstrap repetitions for faster results.
